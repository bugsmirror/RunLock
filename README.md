# **RunLock**

## **About:** 

Bugsmirror RunLock is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) solution that assesses your Android or iOS mobile app against 25+ runtime security threats on real devices. It simulates real-world attacks like rooting, app tampering, MiTM etc. to evaluate app behavior and effectiveness of existing security measures.

## **RunLock ‚Äì Dynamic Runtime Security Testing**

Bugsmirror RunLock is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) solution that thoroughly evaluates your mobile app‚Äôs security posture across 25+ runtime threats, identifying weak points, potential attack vectors, and testing the strength of the existing runtime protection measures. Powered by advanced automation and expert manual review for zero false negative, this assessment helps to protect your app from runtime vulnerabilities. RunLock is aligned with the latest security standards, including the OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard), SEBI CSCRF (Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework), RBI MDDPSC (Master Direction on Digital Payment Security Controls), and NPCI guidelines. RunLock tests your Android & iOS mobile applications thoroughly, revealing risks with precision.

## **Problem Statement**

* Runtime Security is often overlooked in traditional Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

* Attackers bypass traditional static testing approaches and open source solutions

* Lack of fast and reliable runtime testing tool and real device testing options in the market

* Existing runtime testing tools show false positives

* Need of a tool for testing the strength of existing app runtime security measures

## **Why is Runtime Security Testing Necessary?**

Runtime Security Testing is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities that emerge while an app is actively running. This testing approach helps you assess the security posture of your application and ensures you're aware of scenarios that could be exploited by attackers.

## **Statistics of Runtime Security Analysis of Mobile Apps**

In our extensive Runtime Security Audits of more than 1000 mobile applications across the globe, we uncovered alarming trends that underscore the urgent need for stronger mobile app protection:

* **70% of the applications lacked even basic runtime security mechanisms, leaving them wide open to various attack vectors.**

* **Even more concerning, 29% of the remaining companies, despite having some in-house or open-source protection mechanisms in place, are still easily bypassable by an attacker. This means attackers can successfully compromise these apps, despite the presence of basic security measures.**

## **üîç RunLock tests application across 7 critical security domains of the app:**

| Feature | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Device Integrity | Detects device compromise indicators like rooting, jailbreaking, emulator, etc. |
| App Tampering | Identifies repackaging, code modification, and unauthorized changes to app structure. |
| OS Integrity | Checks for vulnerabilities in OS-level components that could impact your app's behavior. |
| Secure Communication | Validates transport layer protections (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) and detects insecure network flows. |
| Mobile Privacy | Assesses how well your app protects personal data and user activity from leaks. |
| Mobile Fraud | Detects abuse patterns and automation-based fraud scenarios. |
| Social Engineering | Examines attack vectors like fake UI injections and phishing surfaces. |
